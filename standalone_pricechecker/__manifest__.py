    'description': """
    Odooâ€™s default Point of Sale system is limited to processing payments in a single base currency. This can be challenging for businesses that serve international customers who wish to pay in foreign currencies.
    POS Multi Currency Payment bridges this gap by allowing cash payments in multiple currencies directly from the POS payment screen. It enables real-time currency conversion, displays accurate transaction details on receipts, and provides a clear breakdown of received currencies at session closing.
    This module offers a seamless experience for both staff and customers, improving flexibility and operational efficiency in global retail environments.
